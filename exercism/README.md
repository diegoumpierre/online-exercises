## About Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.org/) is an open-source platform that provides hands-on programming practice through exercises in a wide variety of programming languages. It encourages mentorship and learning by doing.

## Repository Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Practice Java through real-world, test-driven problems
- Explore idiomatic solutions and alternative approaches
- Improve proficiency with the Java language and its ecosystem

## Structure

Each exercise is organized in its own directory, typically with:

- ✅ Java source code
- 🧪 Unit tests (provided or custom)
- 📝 README or notes per exercise (optional)

Example folder structure:
```
exercism-java/
├── hello-world/
│   ├── src/
│   └── test/
├── two-fer/
│   ├── src/
│   └── test/
...
```
