# Darts

### Problem: Darts
Darts is a game where players throw darts at a target.
In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, 
depending on where the dart lands:
If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.
The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target),
the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1.
